This is an open-source online code editor that supports JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. It's built with Vite.js and inspired by [codi.link](https://github.com/midudev/codi.link). This project is for anyone who wants to write and edit code for these languages directly in their web browser, without needing to set up a local development environment.
